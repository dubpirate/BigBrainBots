# BigBrainBots ü§ñ

Built by William Torkington, Hugh Marshall, and Zach Konings.

## Game Architecture üë∑

The levels were intended to be structured in the following order:

 - Prologue (the Tutorial)
 - World One: Zeuthian Station (2 Levels)
 - World Two: Susanova Canyon (2 Levels)
 - World Three: Raihujin Fortress (2 Levels)
 - World Four: Setlith Chambers (2 Levels)
 
Each level represents a puzzle or set of puzzles the player must solve using the special abilities of the four bots. 

As can be seen in [the Levels directory,](https://github.com/dubpirate/BigBrainBots/tree/master/Content/Levels), three of the four worlds have level models made, and only the [Prologue](https://github.com/dubpirate/BigBrainBots/tree/master/Content/Levels/Prologue_Level) and [Zeuthian Station Level One](https://github.com/dubpirate/BigBrainBots/tree/master/Content/Levels/Zeuthian_Station/Level_01) were fully finished and playable.

## Controls üçä

### Movement ‚úåÔ∏è

__W, A, S, D__ control the movement of each bot, and __the mouse__ controls the camera.

Use __Tab__ or __1, 2, 3, 4__ to switch between bots.

### Special Abilities üëº

Each bot can interact with the environment in different ways. 

StandardBot uses __E__ to activate levers.

FlyBot uses __E__ to press buttons in high up places.

GasBot uses __E__ to activate his aura, that stops robots taking damage from... gas. Yeah, we know.

HeavyBot can sit on pressureplates, because he's heavy.
